# YuvConverter
This app create video from .yuv extension file.

Firstly read .yuv file and convert bytes to true format(4:4:2 or 4:2:2). Then convert bytes to rgb format and create pictures. 
Finally combine pictures and create a video.

For combining pictures i used Accord library and for playing video used vlc extension.
